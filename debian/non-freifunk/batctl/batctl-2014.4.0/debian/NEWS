batctl (2013.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  batctl 2013.5.0 will have the vis commands (vis_mode and vis_data) removed.
  The functionality is not available anymore in the Linux kernel starting with
  v3.13. Instead the batadv-vis daemon should be used together with the alfred
  daemon to replace them. They run in userspace, only need access to the
  batman-adv originators table in debugfs and can already be used.

  The vis_data command will print a warning on stderr when it is used in batctl
  2013.4.0. This is done to inform users early about the upcoming removal. The
  normal output on stdout is not modified. Consumers may have to be modified to
  only read from stdout and ignore stderr.
