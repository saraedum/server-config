fastd v16
=========

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~
* Fix segmentation fault after peers with static IP addresses have been loaded
* Fix segmentation fault when status sockets are used with unnamed peers (e.g. peers authenticated by a on-verify handler)

Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The JSON output of the status sockets has changed

  To fix using the status socket with peers without names or with duplicate names, the
  peers' public keys are now use as the keys in the JSON object.
